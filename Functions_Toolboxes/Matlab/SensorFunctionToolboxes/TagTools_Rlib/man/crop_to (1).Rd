\title{Reduce the time span of data}
\usage{
crop_to(X, sampling_rate = NULL, tcues = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A sensor list, vector, or matrix. X can be regularly or irregularly samples data in any frame and unit.}

\item{sampling_rate}{The sampling rate of X in Hz. This is only needed if X is not a sensor structure. If X is regularly sampled, sampling_rate is one number. sampling_rate may also be a vector of sampling times for X. This is only needed if X is not a sensor list and X is not regularly sampled.}

\item{tcues}{A two-element vector containing the start and end time cues in seconds of the data segment to keep (i.e., tcues <- c(start_time, end_time)).}
}
\value{
A list with 2 elements:
\itemize{
 \item{\strong{X: }} A sensor list, vector or matrix containing the cropped data segment. If the input is a sensor list, the output will also be. The output has the same units, frame and sampling characteristics as the input.
 \item{\strong{T: }} A vector of sampling times for Y. This is only returned if X is irregularly sampled and X is not a sensor list. If X is a sensor list, the sampling times are stored in the list.
}
}
\description{
This function is used to reduce the time span of data by cropping out any data that falls before and after two time cues.
}
\details{
Possible input combinations: crop_to(X, tcues = tcues) if X is a sensor structure, crop_to(X, sampling_rate, tcues) if x is a vector or matrix.

\examples{
         data <- beaked_whale
         d <- find_dives(data$P,300)
         P2 <- crop_to(data$P, tcues = c(d$start[2], d$end[2]))	#crop to 2nd dive
         Xdata <- list(datatest = P2$X)
         plott(Xdata)
         #plot shows the dive profile and acceleration of the second dive
