#' Estimate the vertical velocity 
#' 
#' This function is used to estimate the vertical velocity by differentiating a depth or altitude time series. A low-pass filter reduces the sensor noise that is amplified by the differentiation.
#' 
#' Possible input combinations: depth_rate(p) if p is a list, depth_rate(p,fc = fc) if p is a list, depth_rate(p,fs) if p is a vector, depth_rate(p,fs,fc) if p is a vector.
#' @param p A depth or altitude time series or a list of depth or altitude (e.g., from readtag.R). p can have any units and is in the form of a vector
#' @param fs is the sampling rate of p in Hz.
#' @param fc (optional) A smoothing filter cut-off frequency in Hz. If fc is not given, a default value is used of 0.2 Hz (5 second time constant).
#' @return The vertical velocity with the same sampling rate as p. v has the same dimensions as p. The unit of v depends on the unit of p. If p is in meters, v is in meters/second
#' @note The low-pass filter is a symmetric FIR with length 4fs/fc. The group delay of the filters is removed.
